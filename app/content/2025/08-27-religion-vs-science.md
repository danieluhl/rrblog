> "You know the real difference between me and a believer? It strikes me that
religion, in its essence, seeks to take natural events and ascribe supernatural
causes to them. I, however, seek to take supernatural events and find the
natural meanings behind them. Perhaps that is the final dividing line between
science and religion."

- Jasnah Kholin, The Way of Kings

I recently struggled to explain to my PM exactly why the underlying approach I'd
been seeing feels so wrong. The quote above really struck me as analogous. Here
is the example:

The PM would get some flavor, some _feel_, of what we should do next. Then he
sells it hard. When on calls with customers he pulls them by the nose directly
to a specific answer he is looking for. Then he has the power to say to anyone
in the company, "I talked to the customers, this is what they said".
_Technically_ true, but not truthful. So he goes of selling hard internally and
externally about this great new world we're going to build. None of this, by the
way, is talked over with engineers who will be building the product.

I'm pretty used to ignoring this kind of warped marketing/sales behavior, but
what got to me is the ending. He booked a big launch demo event. To be clear, we
didn't talk about or scope the work or even really decided on what we wanted to
do, and he booked a demo event. This is bonkers.

So how _should_ it work. Returning to the quote above, what the PM here was
doing is taking a nothing burger and making it this magical fix, as if just
talking about it enough was enough to bring it to reality in the world. What we
_should_ do is the opposite. We should first build. Put something into the hands
of real customers and see what happens. Something small and not quite finished,
but something that will give us real data of what real customers will actually
do. Then we should try as hard as we can to not fool ourselves. We should be our
own worst critics poking holes in our design in every way we can to make it
better based on what real customers are doing. Then we should refine or throw
that feature/product away based on the data, not holding onto to any one
idea or set of ideas too strongly, and working hard to not invest too much time
and effort into something that is likely to fail. An it is likely to fail, at
least for the definition of failure we _should_ adopt.

Another analogy came to mind: would you rather have a super fancy sports car
with a crap engine in it, or a normal looking sedan with a race car engine?
Product organizations who take the sell first approach are building the super
flashy car with nothing inside. This may work to sell a few cars, and I'd even
say this is fine as long as you're truthful about what the car really is. But
don't promise it will win races. If you're looking to win the race and really
build the best product, always build first and sell once you know you have
something.
