Please please please don't make me review your AI slop code. Or your AI slop
emails and docs. It's rude and offensive to do so. It would be faster and easier
for me to talk directly to an AI than to do it though you.

I had an experience in a college CS class one time. It was when iPods were all
the rage (pre-iPhone). Having iPods in class was a grey area, they were
distracting but could be ok if you're heads down working. I had mine in, playing
some music, and I needed some help. The professor kindly answered what I needed
and I, in my music stuper, look up and said, "whuut?". Her eyes became daggers
and I realized what an idiot I was and quickly put away my headphones, and later
profusely apologized.

When you send me an AI review, I call out how stupid it is, and you point
fingers at the AI, it's the same situation. I was saying "huh?" like it was my the
iPods fault I wasn't getting it. Clean up your slop before you send it to me. Be
very careful, even more than if you wrote it yourself, that no bugs or weird
things slip through. If you find this more difficult than just writing the code
yourself, then please write the code yourself!
