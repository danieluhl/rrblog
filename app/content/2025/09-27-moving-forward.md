> "To move three steps forward, you must first go three steps deep"

When we find ourselves floundering, spinning our wheels, and getting frustrated
on a problem. Often it means we're not deep enough to "get it". There's often a
simple solution that is evading our thoughts.

First the basics, do you have good sleep, diet, exercise, and meditation? Next
think about the deeper knowledge you may be missing. Dive deeper into the
problem with a mindset of genuine curiosity. Then take a walk. Don't distract
yourself, be bored. Then come back to it.

With this formula you, like I have many times, may find the problem either melts
away or becomes far more interesting and easy to dive into and solve.
