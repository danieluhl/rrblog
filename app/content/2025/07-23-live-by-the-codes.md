There's a great moment in "The Way of Kings" where Dalinar, the "black thorn", a
killing machine who loves the thrill of the fight, is in the middle of a battle
when he suddenly becomes overwhelmed by disgust at what he is doing. The magic
system in the book is based on oaths, codes, and honor, and Dalinar is being
guided in the right direction. Each book in the stormlight archive is also the
title of a book in the book. "The Way of Kings" is a book of old codes that
spell out how one should live.

After reading this I was inspired to make my own set of "codes to live by". The
idea is to look at sage wisdom from sources I trust, then reflect on my own
way of acting and living to see if there are just a few top virtues that I
struggle with. I did a quick search for values I know to be good from
skepticism, stoicisms, and buddhism (see full findings at the bottom of this
post) 

I landed on three:

## 1. Temperance

On The Skeptics' Guide podcast and on Science Based Medicine, Steve Novella
often repeats this one advice for nutrition: eat a wide variety, everything in
moderation. This simple advice that has been around for decades can save you
thousands of dollars and time and hassle with all sorts of fad diets and
supplements. It's not easy, but it is consistently effective. Your body and mind
will thank you.

However, with smaller behaviors it's easy to let this slip - eat just a little
too much candy or play a little too much video games here and there. Soon you'll
realize your whole day is taken up by endulgance.

Temperance relies heavily on mindfulness. You must be vigilant, self aware, and
act with integrity. Temperance for the stoics went all the way to regulating
thought, "control your thoughts, they shape your reality". It is to regulate
desires and passions, avoid extremes, and most importantly, realize you can
transmute the wild energy of passion into love, community, and hard work.

## 2. Speak Mindfully

Never complain, even to yourself.

Do not harbor hatred. Do not speak idly. Say what needs to be said at the right
time, with full truth, affectionately, beneficially, and with a mind of
good-will. 

Truthful, beneficial, altruistic, kind, and timely.

Some public speakers or podcasters are clearly a level above others. It takes a
lot of practice to be good. What "good" means here is consciously choosing the
right words at the right times to convey accurately what you are trying to in
the fewest words possible. That leaves "um" and "like" out of the
sentences. But it also means expanding your vocabulary out to find better words.
It also means being good at reading the room. Is this a time to give ernest
praise? Is it a good time to land a bad joke?

## 3. Embrace Community

Put people first. Practice sympathetic joy, rejoicing in the happiness of others. Let go of anxiety.

Don’t waste time worrying about other people’s opinions. Don’t suffer imagined
troubles. Don’t presume what others think of you.

Sympathetic joy is the opposite of jealousy or envy, you genuinely feel great
for others in their victories and expand their good feelings out to yourself and
then to the world. Think of metta (loving kindness) practice and get into that
mindset often.

For me community means fighting my social anxieties, reaching myself out into
the world to interact genuinely with people where they are. Try to break through
social walls that others put up to form a true connection, however brief. These
moments give life value and are increasingly hard to come by.


# Your Codes

Below I'll dump all the references I used to come up with my codes. With AI I'm
sure you can quickly come up with your own battle to fight.

## General 

- Sympathetic Joy: rejoicing in the happiness of others
- Put people first
- Never be overheard complaining, not even to yourself
- Do only what’s essential.
- Waste no time worrying about other people’s opinions
- Don’t suffer imagined troubles
- Focus on effort, not outcomes
- You’re afraid of death because you won’t be able to do this anymore?
- Choose sympathy over outrage
- Blow your own nose: get active in your own rescue, nobody else can fight this battle
- Think progress, not perfection
- Let go of anxiety
- Do the more difficult thing
- Wake up early
- Be strict with yourself and tolerant of others
- Don’t be afraid to ask for help
- Accept the good stuff without arrogance. Let the bad stuff go with indifference. Neither success nor failure say anything about you. A rock thrown in the air gains nothing by going up, Marcus said, and nothing by falling down.
- Be free of passion and full of love.  It’s that they controlled those emotions and replaced them with love. They loved their fate (amor fati), they loved other people, they loved every minute they were alive. Love, love, love. That’s what you replace it all with.

## Meditations, stoic

1. Focus on what you can control: Aurelius believed that external events are largely outside of our control, but our reactions to them are not. He encouraged individuals to focus their energy on their own thoughts, judgments, and actions, rather than on things they cannot influence. 
2. Embrace adversity as a teacher: Rather than viewing challenges as obstacles, Aurelius saw them as opportunities for growth and self-improvement. He believed that facing difficulties with courage and resilience could lead to inner strength and wisdom. 
3. Live in the present moment: Dwelling on the past or worrying about the future can lead to anxiety and unhappiness. Aurelius emphasized the importance of being fully present in the here and now, appreciating the beauty and opportunities of each moment. 
4. Cultivate inner peace through virtue and reason: Aurelius believed that true happiness comes from within, from living a life of virtue, guided by reason and logic. He encouraged individuals to develop self-awareness, practice self-control, and act with integrity. 
5. Find contentment in simplicity: Aurelius believed that happiness doesn't require material wealth or external achievements. He found joy in simple things like spending time in nature, reading, and engaging in meaningful work. 
6. Practice self-awareness: Understanding your own thoughts, emotions, and motivations is crucial for personal growth and living a more fulfilling life. Aurelius encouraged individuals to examine their inner world and identify their strengths and weaknesses. 
7. Be mindful of your thoughts: Aurelius believed that our thoughts shape our reality. He encouraged individuals to cultivate positive and rational thoughts, rather than allowing negative or irrational thoughts to dominate their minds. 
8. Strive for excellence in all you do: While acknowledging the importance of accepting what you cannot control, Aurelius also emphasized the need to strive for excellence in the things you can. This means approaching every task with diligence, purpose, and a commitment to doing your best. 
9. Remember your mortality: By contemplating the fact of death, Aurelius believed that individuals could gain a greater appreciation for life and live more authentically. This awareness can help prioritize what truly matters and avoid wasting time on trivial pursuits. 
10. Act with kindness and compassion: Aurelius believed that all humans are interconnected and that acting with kindness and compassion towards others is essential for a harmonious society. He encouraged individuals to treat others with respect and understanding, even those who may be difficult.
