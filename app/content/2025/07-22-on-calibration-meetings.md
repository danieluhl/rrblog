Calibration meetings are like a bunch of companies who sell the same good
getting together to agree on a "fair" price. It _could_ work in theory, but is
much more likely a way to monopolize the market and charge extreme prices.

Calibration meetings are popular because they are good for the people in the
meetings, terrible for everyone else. Unfortunately the people in the meetings
are the ones deciding if they should do it. How many other practices follow this
pattern? The decision makers make decisions that benefit themselves over the
company. How could a CEO possibly combat this? How could a CEO not fall into
this same trap? Should they? Should we expect anything else?
