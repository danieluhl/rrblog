Having heroes around who work the extra hours, are passionate and drive, and bring those around them
up while winning the day, is not a bad thing.

Hero culture is created when heroes take a disproportionate share of the rewards for the success of
the team. This may seem impossible to avoid and even a fair system. Why shouldn't the hardest
working people get more reward?

Just as we must recognize that most wealthy people obtained their wealth on the support structures
of society largely by being lucky, we can also must recognize that heroes are built on the backs of
great supporting teams.

We can improve the distribution of reward by separating pay from promotion and by introducing other
means of recognition.

The rockstar may get the promotion quickly but the person doing the glue work and enabling the quick
progress gets a big raise and other recognition for being a key part of the team.
