A good quote that sums up my position on the book [Make Time](https://maketime.blog/):

> Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise, instead, seek what they sought.

- Matsuo Basho

The book is great and I agree with most of it, but it's too light on the core point: each person
needs to [self-experiment](about-habit-disruptors) and practice regular deep reflection to
understand what works for them where and when they are.

## Highlight

- Give equal thought to what's getting dropped to make room for the highlight
- Spinning plates analogy is good, bounce between high level life priorities so none fall (too
  badly) long-term

## Laser Focus

- Use a timer to help allow yourself to let go of everything except the highlight for that time
- Short but frequent breaks (5min breaks every 30min)
- Set a visible reward for larger projects (e.g. box of chocolate, new macbook pro)
- Set your urges as a short-term reward (e.g. if I focus in now, I'll get some tea and a snack on my
  break)
- Take breaks mid-stride, it will be faster and easier to get back into flow when you return

## Energize

These are ongoing curated lists of what personally works to give or take away my energy. Reflect and
document for yourself.

- Walk in the forest with the dog
- Coffee nap
- Healthy snacks all day
- One coffee per day, after being awake for at least one hour
- Daily mindfulness to set the tone for the day
- Threedom or other comedy podcast in driving/alone time
- Incremental improvement in a video game (moderate game time)
- Do the dishes quickly and efficiently
- Take out the garbage
- Refill all our water vessels (two filter pitchers, two coffee machines, three humidifiers, etc.)
- Break down boxes for recycling
- Pick off the next thing from the learning list
- Making the bed in the morning
- Reading good fiction before bed
- Sharing my experiences, philosophy, and learning with people

## Anti-energize (things to avoid)

- Unhealthy or too many snacks
- Too much context switching
- Soda/sugar
- Too much coffee
- Screen time in the bedroom
- Trying to do a retro/reflect/gratitude journal (these just never worked for me)

## A note on media (social media or otherwise)

Over the years I've re-wired my defaults for interaction with the internet to the point I don't feel
the need to even mention social media or other apps/websites here. They just aren't a problem for
me. Same goes for email, slack, and other communication. I've set a boundary and I'm happy with it.
