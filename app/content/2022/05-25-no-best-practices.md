If there was a "best practice" it would be obvious and everyone would be doing it. Part of
[ maturing ](04-29-secondary-emotions-in-software) as an engineer is understanding that everything
has tradeoffs and what tradeoffs to make. You could prescribe the best way to do something under an
enormous amount of constraints but often this misses the opportunity to let someone else grow
through deliberate practice.

Instead of best practices, focus on reasons for tradeoffs and code style. Look at "bad" code and
understand _how_ it got to that state. The process by which things come to be is more important than
the [inputs](05-12-leaders-focus-on-outputs).
