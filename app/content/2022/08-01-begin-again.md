In meditation, when you catch your mind wandering, this is the moment of clarity in the present. The
catching yourself is the meditating.

In life we are perpetually building towards something. Some day will come when all the prep is done
and we can finally start living (retirement?). The catch is, we're already living and there is no
dress rehearsal. The more we can catch ourselves failing to live now in this moment, the more life
we can live.

I lost 10lbs. from trying the habit breaker of no Amazon purchases for a month. Injecting this
discipline permiated into several other parts of my life naturally.

I've found what I wear in the morning greately affects my productivity in the morning.
