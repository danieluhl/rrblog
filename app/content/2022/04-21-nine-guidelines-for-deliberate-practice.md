1. Get an overview of what you're trying to learn
2. Get a coach (or automated) for corrective inputs
3. Be enthusiastic about learning (not arriving at a goal)
4. Breakdown the skill and take one piece at a time
5. Have a beginner mindset (curiosity)
6. Follow the prescribed patter _exactly_ first
7. Practice a little every day
8. Practice on something real
9. Practice at the edge of your capability
