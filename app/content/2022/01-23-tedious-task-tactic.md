The general form is to separate a tedious task into two tasks (preparation::execution) that when
approached in different mindsets or contexts can both be enjoyable (not tedious).

- Prepare the toothbrush::brush the teeth
- Gather/soak all dishes::load dishwasher
- Prepare clothes and tidy workout space::do a workout

The task as a whole gives instant an difficult to control negative feelings - tightening of the
gut/chest, etc.

However, preparing with a servant mindset often feels really good. You know that whoever approaches
the situation later is going to feel great that such preparation was done for them. And knowing
you're helping someone else feel good, feels great in itself.

Now, imagine you had a servant who went into your bathroom and prepared your toothbrush and floss
every morning. Certainly you would be very appreciative, you're living like a king! Not to mention
you wouldn't want their efforts to go to waste. Surely you would graciously and humbly accept their
gift.

It can help to separate the two parts with some time, which can be awkward, and can also give others
you live with the opportunity to execute on your prep (maybe not with the toothbrush). This should
feel great as I'm sure they appreciate the efforts.
