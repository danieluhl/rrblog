The goal is to train the mind to naturally want the things we already have. Each of these can be
individual 10-20 min meditations (deep thought). Focus on the thoughts and feelings that arise when
focusing on the prompt.

1. Think about what it would be like to lose the things you have (including objects, experiences,
   memories, health, family, etc.)
2. Think about how there will be a _last time_ for each and every experience (e.g. picking up your
   child, going for a run, etc.)
3. Think of what would make _today_ the good old days. What do you imagine yourself reflecting back
   on that you can do today. Make your future self nostalgic for the present.
4. You are likely living the dream for thousands of people. Think of those people and all the things
   you have that they want. Think of how lucky you are to be in your position. Were simply born in a
   different place, how different could your experience be.
