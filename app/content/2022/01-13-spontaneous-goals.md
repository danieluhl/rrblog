The title here is a contradiction. Spontaneity is a great word for all those things you so dearly
desire, but the more you try to get them, the further they fall out of reach.

1. Identify when a goal (or goals underlying purpose) is actually a spontaneous phenomenon, and stop
   driving towards it.
2. Notice gently when the spontaneous phenomenon arises, know that it will pass, live in it while
   it's there.
3. Take note of the conditions under which the phenomenon manifests itself, you may not be able to
   seek spontaneity, but you may be able to increase the odds that it will happen.
