We often read something inspiring like "Atomic Habits" or "4000 Weeks" and think yes, if only
everyone read this book and _they_ took the advice to heart. Then we go about our daily business
barely impacted. First take it upon yourself to do the hard deliberate practice. Then let your
actions speak to those around you. After all, you really can't know who's going to take your example
to heart.
