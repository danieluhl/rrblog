Start documents with the definition of done. What needs to be included in this document for it to be
done. What does the reader need to know or do to have gained the information intended in the
document. Then simply write the document to that specification. Specs in all sorts of areas can be
thought of in the TDD mindset:

1. What are you going to do?
2. Did you do it?

This describes the bare bones of scrum. It's also an excellent pattern for accountability buddies.
It also works for planning and accountability at the program level.
