Growing up in Montana skiing every week during the winter we often heard advice on getting caught in
an avalanche or getting lost while hiking or camping. One key piece of advice is to never sleep in
the snow.

Your body will get comfortable and start to fall asleep. Your limbs will be too cold to feel so a
sort of comfort will fall over you and you'll want to rest... forever.

This situation is not unlike the comfort zone, learning zone, and anxiety zone we hear about in the
"learning zone model". If your career is in the comfort zone, your career will die. Always be
learning and adapting because you never walk in the same stream twice.
