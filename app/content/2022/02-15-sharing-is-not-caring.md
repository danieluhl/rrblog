It's easier to share/broadcast information than to make real progress learning and using skills.
Studying and sharing and talking at length is very different from instinct and muscle memory that
comes with practical experience and deliberate practice.

Some people look like they're doing it all. They're not. You are just as capable of doing as much as
them. Focus on what's real, not on how much you share.
