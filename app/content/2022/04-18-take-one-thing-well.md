For each person you interact with frequently, look for the one great behaivor/attribute that you can
replicate and use to evolve.

People are incredibly complex and interesting. Older people have more memories, backstory, and most
importantly they have build behaviors over time that work well for them.

It reasons to assume then, no matter your overall impressions of the people around you, there is
likely at least _one_ great attribute you can replicate from each person you meet.
