Motivation is doing something because there's nothing else you'd rather be doing. Discipline is
doing something despite wanting to do other things because you know it's the thing you _should_ be
doing.

With a sotic mindset, we can turn discipline into motivation by wanting to do the very thing we
should be doing. We can think through the short term suffering to the long term gains to the
endeavour. We can reassure ourselves that we are lucky to be in a position to be able to do the right
thing.
