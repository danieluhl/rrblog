QA, or "assuring quality", is simply a form of checking your work. Trust but verify. Check
assumptions.

Examples of QA:

- Practicing TDD
- Pair programming
- Showing a mock or MVP to real users
- Adding logs and monitoring with well calibrated dashboards

Quality, like security, accessibility, design, and performance, must all be built into the product
at every step.
