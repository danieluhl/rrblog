Not always is leadership demanding something of you, your team, or your org, from a place of command
and control. You can be both mission driven, and occasionally receive something specific of great
importance from on high. This is to be expected, but only works in a shared world view of this being
the exception, not the rule, and in the presence of strong two way trust between teams building the
product and leadership setting the vision.
