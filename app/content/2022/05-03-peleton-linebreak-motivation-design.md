Linebreak is awesome! It strikes an astoundingly good balance between motivation and autonomy.

Peleton has traditionally been a person yelling motivational BS while you strain to hear the music
and follow the instructions.

Linebreak is a game where you're pedaling down an infinite track. The lane indicates the resistance
and you get points for being in the right lane.

In the lane there are two other ways to get points: keeping a set pace, and doing all-out sprints.
Linebreak indicates these areas with bright colors and indicators and both are forgiving enough to
make you feel good for just getting the points.

At a program level, you can choose the difficulty and time of the course you take so each day you
can work to incrementally improve over the long term.
