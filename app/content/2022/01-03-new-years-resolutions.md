It's probably no surprise to anyone reading this that I think new years resolutions are crap. Why
resolve at this arbitrary point in time? Look at the data about how many resolutions are really
helpful.

However, similar to [Friday Nights](cant-stop-wont-stop), there is something about the turning of
the page of the year that motivates a reflective and goal setting mindset. So if you find yourself
unable to control getting caught up in the cultural wave, I have a word of advice. Focus less on
goals and more on skills (e.g. improve reading ability, not read 100 books). But not nonsense skills
like juggling, but identify real internal skills that come in handy in all things in life. Focus
improving your skill to get out of bed even when you don't feel like it. Or your ability to quickly
recognize [secondary](secondary-emotions-in-software) vs primary emotions. Or maybe you want to
improve your ability to be patient and listen more carefully. Or maybe it's your ability to
recognize and appreciate the extraordinary in the mundane. Or the ability to love and treat all
beings the same way you would your closest family.

Work on something this year that you'll look back on for the rest of your life as a turning point
for the better.
