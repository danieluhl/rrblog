Just like you _are_ testing so you might as well automate it before writing code, you also _are_
pair programming so you might as well do it live. Writing is a conversation with another human and
the quality of the writing depends on the context of the reader.

## Testing

1. Before code (TDD)
2. After code
3. On push
4. Pre-merge
5. In staging
6. In prod
7. By customers (fix when you see errors or complaints)

## Pair Programming

1. As you code
2. Via code review
3. Via issue/integration request (someone read your code, maybe it's you!)
