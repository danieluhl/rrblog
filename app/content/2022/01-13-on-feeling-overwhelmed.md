Sometimes when I get into a good mindfulness session, I start to feel overwhelmed. I hear my heart
beating, the movement and sounds of the breath, tingling from my hands, stress pulls at my chest and
gut, thoughts and sounds jump into my awareness, it's a cacophony.

The funny thing here is I'm peacefully sitting doing nothing, which is sort of ridiculous. The fact
that I can be overwhelmed when "doing nothing" is insightful for any other time I'm feeling
overwhelmed. It exposes that on any level, to some extent, it's ridiculous to feel overwhelmed. With
that insight, I've found it quick and easy to get past the negative and useless feeling of
overwhelm.

> But I really have so much going on!

This may be. But, and this may be surprising, you can only do as much as you are capable of doing.

The optimal approach to having a lot to do, is with calm priority, one thing at a time, with
sufficient energy. Exactly the opposite of what the overwhelming feelings push you to do. First take
care of yourself so you can think clearly. Then prioritize and work on the most important thing
first. There really is no more you can do so there's no point in feeling any negative feelings about
your situation.
