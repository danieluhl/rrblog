Coding will always have some art. But with automated code generation like Github Copilot the trend
is looking to be towards more science at the edges, and pushing the art to the automated tooling
building.

We see this trend towards science both on business side with lean practices (see Lean Enterprise
book) and with increase in emphasis on TDD, type systems, and functional programming blends.

To be future proof in your 30+ year coding career, always be aiming towards teams building the
tooling (platform teams) or be the best at the science.
