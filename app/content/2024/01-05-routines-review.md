## How this works

We are what we do. We are a verb, not a noun. Failing to progress _is_ being stressed and they cause
each other. Procrastination _is_ being scattered, anxious, worried, and jittery. The goal here is to
break the cycle by relaxing and taking control.

- Health comes first, physical and mental
- Pay high value attention to family and friends, nurture, listen, invest
- Start relaxed, set direction, laser focus! get hyped!
- _Trust_ your notes on what gives/saps energy, do them even if you don't want to. Practice
  discipline
- Reminder experiments can take a week (e.g. no phone for a week) but being comfortable in a new
  schedule takes ~3mo (e.g. wakeup at 5am with no alarm). Identify which is which and don't label as
  a failed experiment before time has done it's work.
