### Coffee

I recently purchased a top of the line drip coffee maker for $350 from Williams Sonoma. I was
dreadfully underwhelmed. The aeropress was better and only $15. About this point I realized I really
don't like either, I prefer espresso drinks, specifically a great flat white. I learned that a
cappuccino is a latte with less milk and a flat white is a cappuccino with a double shot.

So after going waaay to far into the weeds of researching all things coffee I bought what I think is
a good level of automation vs control to get the best coffee I want in the morning. I got the
[breville barista express](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/breville-barista-express-espresso-maker/)
and swapped out the double shot basket with the best one I could find on amazon. This gives you
control over the grind size, dose, tamp, shot, and milk while taking care of the temp and pressure
for you. To me this is the right balance for a casual espresso enthusiast because if the temp or
pressure seem wacky you can adjust the grind and dose to fit and once you find a rhythm it's very
little effort when you just want that first cup in the morning.

~~I then got the bluebottle two week coffee subscription specifying their espresso blends. They send
helpful dose, temp, and timing on an info card with every bag. Then I got an adjustable distribution
and tamping tool to further automate that part (although it does need adjusting when changing beans
sometimes).~~

UPDATE: bluebottle raised their coffee subscription prices so I found the
[Awesome Coffee Club](https://awesomecoffeeclub.com/) and haven't looked back. They source well and
donate ALL profit to a good cause.

### Hoodie

UPDATE 2: [Duckworth Powder Hoodie](https://www.duckworthco.com/products/mens-powder-hoody) This is
my top pick for outdoor midlayer hoodie. Not as great for indoors as it's too warm. Medium price,
runs a bit baggy, super soft and super warm. The style of the folded hood is so much better than
drawstrings I wonder why others don't do this. Only downside I've found is the cuffs are frayed
style so it rolls up a bit at the bottom and my work gloves' velcro pulls on the cuff threads quite
a bit.

UPDATE: My new fav is the
[SAULT pullover hoodie](https://saultne.com/products/east-coast-pullover-sweatshirt). It runs a bit
skinny but the softness is amazing.

My current hoodie strategy is to buy one new
[Amazon Essentials hoodie](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NYBGWKG/) each year. It's soft and
durable, looks great, and you don't need to worry about the price.

~~If you're looking for the absolute best hoodie, I recommend the
[Feat Hoodie](https://featclothing.com/collections/the-softest-hoodies-ever) but beware, I would
mine did have noticeable wear after one year too. And I can't bring myself to spend this much every
year.~~

I do NOT recommend the
[flint and tinder 10 year hoodie](https://huckberry.com/store/shop/flint-and-tinder-10-year-collection).
Yes it may last longer, but you'll suffer through every moment of wearing it. Super uncomfortable,
not stretchy, not very warm.

### Underwear: Quince

UPDATE 2: Quince is a bit expensive but their cotton boxer briefs are incredible!
Truly above any other in the price range I've tried, including MeUndies.

UPDATE: Me Undies has raised their prices so I've fully switched to Puma from Costco. Cheap and
super comfortable.

### [Undershirts, long sleeve shirts: Uniqlo!](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men/heattech)

Uniqlo is cheap and astoundingly comfortable. The heattech undershirts are great for winter and the
airism for summer. They're durable taking months of washing without losing any comfort or stretch.
Same goes for the socks and long sleeve shirts.

The only problem I've had with Uniqlo is that they have so many versions of the shirts that are
branded slightly differently and once in a while I'll get something that's not quite as comfy by
accident. But it's cheap so no big deal.

If you are really picky about undershirts, the best I've ever owned is the
[Lulu Lemon T-shirts](https://shop.lululemon.com/c/mens-t-shirts/). The lack of branding is
appreciated and the seams and fit are quality + stretch.

~~Their most expensive socks are about on-par with the nice bambas socks. Honestly a toss up in my
mind between those two for winter socks. For summer socks I go with cheap
[amazon ones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MY76HHT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
I don't mind throwing out more frequently.~~

UPDATE: [The Awesome Socks Club](https://awesomesocks.club/) has introduced ankle high! This is now
my go-to for socks. They are still not as durable as I would prefer but the subscription that I can
feel good about is worth it for me.

### Relaxed Pants

The
[Vuori Sunday Performance Jogger](https://vuoriclothing.com/products/sunday-performance-jogger-black)

After years of frustration with baggy, ugly sweatpants, I've finally found what I've been looking
for. They're more "athleasure", and they're very expensive at $89, but one pair lasts a few years.

The one thing I was worried about with these is the tight ankle cuff. Let me assure you, it's super
stretchy and will not be a problem.

If you know of a similar product for less $$ I'd love to try it out but given the number of fails
here I'm skeptical such a thing exists.

### [Seat pad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LC7M5Z9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

I went through a few of these before finding this gem. Good price and super comfy. I got one for my
wife too.

### [Hooded Shirt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X61676S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

I hike a lot. In the spring and winter and even sometimes in the summer I'll wear this hooded shirt
with a baseball cap. You can throw the hood up to protect from the sun or to give a little extra
warmth (not much tho). It's super stretchy and breathable which is perfect for running through the
woods. Also great for keeping insects off the arms and neck. In the winter you can also add this to
layer up. It's probably the most versatile piece of clothing I own and an incredible price.

UPDATE: the
[Vuori Ponto Performance half zip hoodie](https://vuoriclothing.com/products/ponto-performance-half-zip-hoodie-platinum-heather)
is 5x more expensive but a great upgrade version if you can afford it. I have one of these and about
3 of the amazon ones.

### [Travel Clothing](https://shop.bluffworks.com/)

I've purchased almost everything bluffworks offers and have yet to be disappointed. If they have the
shorts in stock grab a few because last time they sold out they were out for 2 years before coming
back. If you like pockets you'll love these, there's layered back pockets and zipper pockets in the
pockets. Same for the sport coat - so many pockets and zipper pocket inside a sport coat is great.
The pants are what initially drew me into this brand. Stretchy and comfortable I'll swap between
sweatpants and these pants as they're about equally comfortable. They don't provide much for heat so
not for winter hikes but outside of that they are amazing with 4 way stretch and comfort. But the
button-up shirts are great, again little hidden zipper pocket and pocket in the breast pocket, love
these pockets!

I haven't tried their shirts because I don't see them beating Uniqlo and are more expensive.

### Sunglasses

If I ever get sunglasses I go cheap as possible because I don't like trying to take good care of
expensive things that are likely going on an adventure with me. I have no great recommendations
here.

### Whisky

There are four primary categories of whisk(e)y I enjoy based on mood, time of year, etc.

1. Highland, Speyside, Japanese: fruity malts

Light and fruity malts are middle of the road and end up in one of my infinity bottles. These are
tasty without overpowering and are the most versatile for pairing with activity or food. To find a
good one of these look for something that doesn't mention smoke or peat (or explicitly mentions no
peat) that has "non-chill filtered", "no color added", and is 46% ABV or more, also generally
lighter color is better. Find one for under $90 if you want to guarantee you won't feel bad if it's
not amazing.

2. Island, Islay: Peaty Malts

Ardbeg, Laphroaig, Lagavulin, Bunnahabhain, bruichladdich, if it's fun to practice and learn to say,
it's probably a smokey peaty monster of a scotch. I enjoy these primarily in the winter time to warm
up next to a fire or in a travel flask on a nice hike. I keep a separate infinity bottle for these
as mixing them with anything will destroy it (wash out your glasses and bottles!). I enjoy the base
line of each of these distilleries but also have had great luck with their experimental lines. Most
recently Ardbeg Wee Beastie. Prepare to spend $100-150 and not regret it one bit!

3. High proof, rare, independent bottles

Scottish Malt Whisky Society, Alexander Murray, Single Cask Nation, Gordon & Macphail. I've yet to
have anything from any of these bottlers that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. If you can find someone
with a SMWS membership it takes the edge off the price too making these some of the best buy's I've
ever made. Look for cask strength and single cask when possible (50% ABV minimum!). The huge variety
and interesting experience of each one is something to be cherished. I like sipping these over
months taking them out only for special occasions or when the feeling really hits.

4. Bourbon and american malts

The problem with bourbon is not the corn, it's the new oak barrels. They give a wood tannin taste
that's overpowering and just not for me. That said, american whiskeys are evolving interesting ways
to cover this nasty first-fill taste, most notably by not using first fill casks (not bourbon) or
finishing in wine or beer barrels.

I'll enjoy bourbon once in a long while in a larger glass with some ice. Water it down and chill it
to take away some of the nasty wood taste and it can be a creamy slightly woody delight.

To find an american whiskey I'll enjoy I look for 46% or higher ABV, malt over grain if possible
(aka not bourbon), something finished in wine cask, and it's hard to find but a whiskey not aged in
new oak (again, this rules our bourbon). Basically, I don't like bourbon.

### [Fleece Sheets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074PZ6GCB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

There's nothing better than fresh fleece sheets in the winter!

### Smells!

I'm on the spectrum of super-smellers. Smell is tied so strongly to memory and I often delight or
disgust in the sillages many others fail to notice. Normally this is an augment to life but when it
comes to picking a cologne or perfume for the wife, I'm VERY particular.

This gonna sound... not typical for me, but it's true: my wife and I were in Milan for fashion week.
I had a side-quest to hunt down the parent company that makes the store smell for Moncler (one of my
all time favorite smells). Unfortunately they refused to give up the goods. But while wandering the
streets we were pulled into a random perfumery. I instantly fell in love with Papyrus Oud. It
captured the essence of growing up camping in the forests of Montana. Later I discovered my current
favorite smell of all time: Milky Musk.
