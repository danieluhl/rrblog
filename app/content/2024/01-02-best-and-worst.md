[Lachesim](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/64620271186/lachesism) is roughly the
longing for the clarity of disaster.

Today, as has been true for all time, we tend to think the world is falling apart. But we're not in
a disaster (yet) as severe as a world war, famine, disease, or global worming effects. We're on the
precipice of all of these and more, but none have taken hold and given the clarity and priority that
comes with proper disaster.

Anxiety, drug use, and suicide are rising. In absence of a real tragedy in our lives we are
overwhelmed by the 2nd-5th priority concerns. Realize you can't take on everything and pick your
battle. Along the way, enjoy how great it is to live in such a great time.
