Take the analogy of mowing a forgotten yard or shaving a beard or legs for the first time in a while.
If you go try to get everything perfect if you go it's going to be hard, slow, and miserable. If,
however, you accept you're leaving some bits behind that you can go back and clean up later, and
embracing moving forward despite this future work, you'll move faster and gain greater overall
comprehension. Cutting the grass twice if often easier, faster, and more enjoyable and we can
approach learning in the same way. Move fast and pick up what you can, but be practical and don't
get hung up on memorization and getting everything first pass.
