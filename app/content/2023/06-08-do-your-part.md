In a relationship, if you _feel_ like you're doing 60-75% of the heavy lifting, it's probably ~50%
or less. Unfortunately this means _both_ sides will feel like the other is slack off. This is
something you just have to constantly remind yourself of.

The same is true for unfamiliar roles in a team. It may seem like your manager, PM, CTO, analyst, or
engineer does way less than you do. They probably _feel_ the same about you. What's important is
realizing we're all doing the best we can with what we have and that feeling is natural. Don't let
it take over your behavior.
