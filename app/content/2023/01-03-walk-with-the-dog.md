I went to the yard the other day and found so much dog poo. Where did all this come from? When did
they have time? Have I really not picked up in this long? Small steps add up quicker than we
realize, both positive and negative.

## Positive

Incremental progress with [deliberate practice](04-21-nine-guidelines-for-deliberate-practice)

- Weeding the garden and fixing things around the house
- Code debt, refactoring abstractions
- Exercise
- Not drinking
- Tool sharpening
- Reading
- Projects
- Cleaning dog poo

## Negative (unless your job/hobby)

- Time on media
- Time gaming

Best to make persistent, validated, incremental steps with empirical results, both in the
maintenance of future negatives, and the pursuit of cumulative positives.
