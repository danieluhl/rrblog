# Single Tasking In A Multi Tasking World

Multi-tasking as most think it exists is an illusion. We are able to do multiple things at once, of
course, but this is more like background-threading. We, like JavaScript, have only one main thread
that can be doing intense learning, practicing, memorizing, etc. When we try to split that thread,
like JS, things tend to get overly complicated and don't work.

[Prioritize](priority-is-about-taking-away) and do one thing well.
