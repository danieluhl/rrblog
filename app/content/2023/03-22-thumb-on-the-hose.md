Since [multi-tasking is a myth](single-tasking-in-a-multi-tasking-world) we should focus on doing
one thing well and one thing fast. This also works with teams. Like putting your thumb over the end
of a hose, reducing work in progress (WIP) can speed everything up. Think of the team like a single
brain - each part is focused on the same area, each loaded up with the same information, each
processing, exploring, and solving problems for the group as a whole. Two minds are always better
then one when focusing on a single thing.
