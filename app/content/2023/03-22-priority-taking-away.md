Priority is about NOT doing the many "top priority" items on your list. Like a mustache is just a
beard without the chin bits, or being vegetarian as mostly about NOT eating meat. Focus is mostly
about how well you can avoid the 2nd priority item.

It can help to pause for a moment to dwell on the reality of your situation. You have capacity to
[do one thing](single-tasking-in-a-multi-tasking-world). This means if you're working on a project
for work, you're not spending time with your family, or fixing up your house, or taking care of your
pets, or reading that book you've been wanting to get to, or exercising, etc. All of these things
are important and you get to do only one now. Pick that one thing carefully, understand the gravity
of that choice, put your full self and attention into it, and do it in the most professional,
productive, kind hearted way you can.

For me, a flexible but [regular routine](routines-review) helps push me to keep a balance between
care, productivity, art, creativity, health, etc.
