After nine long years at one company I've been laid off in the great tech downturn of 2023.

I've noticed when getting laid off there's a lot of "support" that I would categorize as a largely
distracting. Moving on is about letting go and understanding the temporary nature of the job that
existed all along. The mind tends to repeat negative feeling/thoughts over and over to hold on to
them. But if we can shortcut the repeating, they can quickly fade away shortening our suffering from
days to a matter of minutes.

The "alumni" chats (there are three discord channels and a slack channel so far) are not doing much
for me to move on and find the next job.

## First Moves

My first move was to take a week to do "whatever I want". Which is already constrained by hundreds
of variables, but what I ended up doing during that time was continuing my learning list and coding
problems.

Second week is going to be all about specific interview prep and applying to companies. Wish me
luck!

## Update Jul 2023

After two months I received three job offers and took one that was not the highest paying, but
seemed to have the best culture. This is my first startup experience and so far it's been fantastic.
I've re-ignited my passion for coding and renewed my faith in the ability of a company to do things
right.
