If something is difficult, often it's best to do it ALL the time. It's easier and much more
enjoyable to do a little gardening each day than trying to do it all at once and expecting a good
result.

If you take $10k and invest at 100% for 10 years you'll end up with a little over $10M. If you
instead invest at 10% for 100 years you'll end up with over $100M.

We tend to overestimate our abilities in the short term and underestimate in the long term.

I suspect that this is why it's advantageous for large companies to have short (6mo) review cycles.
People are only evaluated on short-term and therefore can be kept at lower wage for larger outcomes
for longer.

Do all the time:

## Coding

- Testing
- Security
- Accessibility

## Health

- Working out
- Eating healthy (not snacking)
- Meditate (in some way or another, could actually be working out)
- Learn something
