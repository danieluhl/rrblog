One of the most important concepts in code is picking the right abstraction. Test first development
from a user behavior perspective helps us get to the right abstraction sooner.

Over time, the API surface area of any abstraction may increase, purpose can shift, and we can go
from transparency, to muddy.

Keeping the glass onion in mind is helpful to remember that while we strive to make abstractions to
gain efficiencies in maintenance, reliability, and encourage representation of the domain model, we
must also ensure that these benefits are not overshadowed by obfuscation.

A good glass onion codebase lets engineers "see through" the abstraction to quickly understand
what's happening underneath without having to dig through obscure tangles of code.

Good typing, good naming, good file structure, and frequent refactoring to fit a ubiquitous language
and domain model are all great for creating a glass onion codebase.
