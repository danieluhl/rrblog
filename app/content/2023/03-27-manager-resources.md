Research tells us the problem: What’s the current way people do this, without the new solution? When
does the current way not work? What are they trying to do when it doesn’t work? How will they know
if the new way is working better? These MUST be known before reaching for solutions and at all
downstream phases of a project. These are the walls that constrain all other activity. With these,
future decisions are fast because we have the information necessary to make a good call.
