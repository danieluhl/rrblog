The experience of suddenly becoming aware that you are driving. Waking up every morning with no
recollection of the last seven hours. Walking through a doorway and instantly forgetting why you're
there. These are all cases where one person in your head is not talking enough to the other people.

Luckily, all the people renting space in your mind all have a common landlord that must approve all
actions: the pre-frontal cortex. If you have a lazy landlord, practice
