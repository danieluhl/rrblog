It's so much worse when something is working and you don't know why. If there's a bug or something
broken then you at least have some indication of where the problem is and a path to experimenting to
see what might fix it, but if it's working and you don't know why then it indicates a fundamental
gap in knowledge about the system and it's time to buckle down for a long night of exploring the
code deeper than before.
