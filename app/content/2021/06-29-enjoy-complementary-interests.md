I used to get major FOMO (fear of missing out) when I heard about activity that others in my
organization were doing that vaguely related to what I was doing or that were what I wanted to be
doing.

I would think things like, "why wasn't I consulted on this", or, "who died and made you king of that
thing". I felt others didn't have the right to pursue their passion if it aligned too closely with
mine.

Closely associated with this thought is the fallacy (I forget the exact name) that says everyone
needs to be caring about the most important thing at all times.

> "How can you worry about the price of fruit when a genocide is happening?"

We must accept that each person has different interests and passions and while it is important to
generally be good and charitable people, we have to accept that not everyone should be focusing on
the same thing at the same time.

The same goes for work. I've transitioned from FOMO to a position of encouragement and service
because I know the more people in my organization passionate about he same things I am, the more the
organization will remain a place I love to work. Now I celebrate those who go above and beyond doing
what they (and I) love to do and get promoted for it.

It's a subtle mindset change, but incredibly meaningful for my overall happiness.
