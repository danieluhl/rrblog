Sometimes the best way to get something is not to drive after it in a "try-hard" mode, but rather to
cultivate the best conditions by which that thing is most likely to happen naturally.

## For Example

- Meditating on [easy mode](05-20-illusion-of-the-perfect-buddha) creates a situation in which
  you're more likely to become enlightened
- Hanging out with people who do the job you want (1:1s with higher level folks) can put you in
  their mind so when the situation arises, you may be first to get the position you've always wanted
