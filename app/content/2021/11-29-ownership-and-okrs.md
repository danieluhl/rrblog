A PM recently showed a graph that looks roughly like this:

![value-effort](/assets/value-effort.png)

This works for engineers and teams which are maintaining existing software or implementing existing
solutions. In other words, areas where software needs to be built and maintained without innovation
or customer feedback.

But when building and innovating on a _product_ I think this misses the point. We rarely know the
value _or_ effort, making this graph obsolete. When we make OKRs that pre-determine _what_ we're
going to build, we remove responsibility, accountability, and let's be honest, life fulfillment from
the people actually doing the work (vs planning the work).

Engineers cannot be graded on outcomes if they've been spoon fed the outcome (predicted) before they
start their work. THE JOB of an engineer is to build something with a good outcome that aligns with
the business and customer needs.

Good OKRs are less, "we will build this awesome thing because we know it's high value", and more
like, "we know our business needs to go in this general direction to succeed". Approach like you
would a doctor, not a waiter. We're all trying our best to solve the same problems.
