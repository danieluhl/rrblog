# What is my job?

For a long while now I've been unsure of what my job is. This should sound alarming to any manager
or CEO, but I've always had good reviews and continue to get promoted so I know I'm doing something
valuable. But it's not coding, coaching, or managing. Sure, I can do all those things, but I find I
have a desire that's quite unique that drives my core activity through priority.

Finally this year a manager suggested to me that I may want to look at the job title "Developer
Advocate". In my head this is someone who goes to conferences and talks about code more than writing
code. But as I looked through the definition, I found more and more that it fit exactly with my
internal motivations.

## What is a developer advocate?

Part of what resonates with me about this position is that it's so difficult to pin down. At the
heart of it, I'd say that a developer advocate is someone who feels deeply that it's an injustice
that everyone on the planet is not a software engineer. They care deeply about the accessibility and
consumption of tooling and languages and won't stand for poor documentation, onboarding, trainings,
or lack of enthusiasm around tech. They find the ecosystem so exciting that they need to share with
someone and contribute to the community.

Many engineers want to simply solve hard problems and would love to have a technical writer by their
side to take the communication and community side. However, many companies don't have the resources
to hire enough technical writers to make this workflow possible. Developer advocates step up here to
fill in the gaps.

## Defining a Role

One problem, the large company I work at doesn't have a "developer advocate" role. So I've made this
my mission and here's my plan.

![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qgdtc4dkolae4vm8iyoa.png)

First and easiest, **write down the activities I've already been doing** for the last few years that
fall under developer advocate. Note that these are not yet well recognized as engineer tasks that
can count towards promotions.

- Writing blog posts
- Managing our documentation system
- Doing tech talks (internal and meetups)
- Doing trainings
- Working on psychological safety and learning zone
- Promoting community building in the company
- Advocating for open-source

Second, I need to **convince senior management that these activities have an impact** equal or
greater than the impact I'd be having as my traditional role description (senior engineer). This is
an ongoing effort that I'll give an update to in a while but my plan is to meet with our product
managers and talent development teams to find metrics that we can agree are valued at the corporate
level. Then I'll need to track those metrics and focus on moving the needle.

The difficulty here is going to shift the perception of engineering managers to agree that these
activities are both highly valuable and that it takes a unique set of skills (senior engineer +
excellent communicator) to do this role well.

Finally, I need to define the role in terms of our performance review process and open the door for
others to go down this career path.

## Caring, Floundering, and Finding

If there's a lesson here, it's to reflect and care deeply about your internal priorities as they
relate to your role. At the end of this, even if I find I'm not providing as much value as I
expected, I'd rather take a pay cut and title change than re-arrange what I feel is deeply
important.

It's been a tough couple years. I've often felt lost, like the work I love is undervalued at my
company. Like I'm not fitting any traditional mold for an engineering career. But with the discovery
of the developer advocate role I'm more thankful than ever that my company allowed me to explore and
adapt for so long, and I'm finally primed for showing just how valuable I can be in this new role.
