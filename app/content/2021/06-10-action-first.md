## How I normally work

- Should we do this?
- How do we plan it?
- Where do we track it, success metrics?
- RFC, respond to comments, get it merged
- Epic + Tickets
- Planning and prioritization, pull it in the sprint
- Who wants to take which tickets?
- I’m taking this one, done! Here’s a PR!

## Attributes to Strive For

- Grounded in reality
- Action first
