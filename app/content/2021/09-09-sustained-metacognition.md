Metacognition is simply thinking about your own thinking.

Over time you'll find the ability to sustain metacognition longer an longer and I'm confident with
enough practice, some level of metacognition can be sustained at all times throughout the day (and
sometimes when sleeping).

Part of your mind becomes like the surface of water reflecting back everything that appears. The
energy patterns ([thoughts](09-09-what-are-thoughts)) in the mind all appear here and are all
considered by the best decision maker we have: the prefrontal cortex.
