"When driving on a two-way highway you can't cross the solid yellow line". This is what we learn
when starting to drive. My literal mind said, "oh yeah?!" and crossed the line quite easily, as a
car is much bigger and capable than that small yellow line.

Legality aside, there are tons of mental blocks we put up especially around social norms. We've
built up such a complex that we can't even see the physical possibility of crossing that line.

For example, think about buying something, walking out of the store, and immediately walking back in
and returning it. Does thinking about this give you anxiety? Is this a yellow line that should not
be crossed? What biases or pre-conceived notions drive the anxiety? If you immediately regret your
purchase or felt pushed around by a sales person, then go return the thing!

A couple caveats for this path of experiential exploration:

1. Ensure your actions are safe and lawful (unlike passing with a solid yellow line)
2. Think through the worst case scenario. This can also give you confidence and set good
   expectations.
3. If the action gives you significant anxiety, invite a friend along and explain what you're doing
   so they can be there to support if things go sideways.

Growing up in Montana meant I could get my drivers license at age 14. Needless to say this comes with pros and cons, I was not a good driver.

One thing that struck me then and I've had countless analogous experiences of since, is how the rules of the road sit in the mind. The passenger would say something like, "you can't cross a solid yellow line". The learning here is that you're legally allowed to pass cars when the dotted line is on your side, but double yellow solid means do not pass.

Of course my overly literal response was, "the car is bigger than that yellow line and actually it's quite easy to cross, look I'll show you!". Legality aside, there are tons of "solid yellow lines" in our society, careers, and personal lives. And these unwritten rules become quite crufty over time.

We often take the rules too seriously and build up complexes against people who violate those rules. This is where much of road rage comes from. Anyone going faster than us is a maniac and anyone going slower is a moron. If someone cuts you off they're a danger to society but when you need to squeeze in at the last minute the person not letting you in is an uncaring jerk. -->
