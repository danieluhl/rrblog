# Shoveling Sucks

Living in the northeast shoveling driveways is a known pain. This year I got a small electric
snowblower which helped a bit but it's always been a chore. My back aches after, it's cold and wet
and often early in the morning so we can get the car out for the day.

## I need a sledding hill!

This year due to travel restrictions it didn't make much sense to take our usual winter vacation out
of state. I have a 1yo boy and I wanted to introduce him to sledding. Local tubing places have
height restrictions he does not meet.

After much research I looked out the window and realized I have a pretty good slope in my yard. Just
need to pile up some snow. So I took an afternoon and built a curving path with walls so you don't
fly out and a big wall at the end to catch you. It was awesome. The baby giggled the whole way down.
We spent the next two weeks tubing every day!

## Wait, shoveling is awesome?

Only in later reflection did it hit me: the activity of shoveling in the yard was physically the
same as shoveling the driveway, but my mental state was profoundly different. I actually enjoyed it.
How could this be? And, if I can deconstruct this phenomenon, could I enjoy shoveling the yard just
as much? Or even expand this to apply to other chores I dislike?

## Key differences

**Driveway**

- Needs to be done (no autonomy)
- Known solution (no creativity)
- Same every year (no variety)
- Result is restored ability to drive the car

**Yard**

- I had the idea
- I decided _how_ to form the hill
- I did the work on my time
- I planned out each phase, got creative with the process
- Result is something both I and others enjoy

## Shifting State of Mind

If something is boring, turn it into a game. Maybe next time I'll try to get all the snow in one
area and build an igloo.

When my wife pesters me to go shovel I shouldn't take this as a burden, but as a sign of how
grateful she is that I'm around to take care of these sorts of tasks. I'm much happier when I'm
doing something that I know others will enjoy.
