We tend to think that we're getting paid to do something that others either can't or won't do and
when work feels fun then it somehow doesn't count. But anywhere you turn to see people having fun
you can find others getting paid for that thing. Look how many hundreds of thousands of people make
a living playing video games.

When you find work that is also fun, or find someone to pay you for having fun, don't squander it or
shy away. What's fun for you may not be fun for everyone and that's ok. I learned at an early age
that I actually enjoy doing dishes. Sometimes I strategically kept this a bit of a secret to help
build good will, but it's carried me well through a few restaurant jobs and with keeping things tidy
at home.

Learning and growing can also be fun, this doesn't mean it's not work or that it's not your job.
